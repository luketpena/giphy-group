## Create Database and Tables

See the `database.sql` file for database setup and details. It offers some of the SQL to get you started but you'll need to set up your tables and the relationships between them. 

## Development Setup Instructions

* Run `npm install`
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server` to start the server
* Run `npm run client` to start the client
